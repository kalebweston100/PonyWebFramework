            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Pony is meant to be an ultra-simple web framework for quick and 
                efficient development of static sites.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="motivation">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>I found that while developing sites for clients, 
                I was doing the same tedious setup with other web frameworks that 
                had functionality that was overkill for the projects.</p>

            <p>Pony is innately unopiniated towards how you want to develop. 
                It provides simple functionality for creating a Single Page Application,
                and with such a small codebase it should be easy for developers to understand 
                everything it does under the hood. Simply create the pages as divs with an id and
                add the page id to the array in app.js. The load_page method can then be used to 
                asynchronously switch the page being displayed in the #app div. The backend is a
                custom asynchronous multi-tasking server coded in Rust, so it handles multiple connections
                efficiently.
